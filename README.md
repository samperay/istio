# istio 

If you've worked with Kubernetes then you've almost certainly heard about Istio.
Istio gives a really rich suite of tools for monitoring, managing and securing your Kubernetes clusters.

On this course you will be using Istio to:

visualise a running cluster, microservice architectures are complicated. Istio will give you a graphical view of your system right down to the pod level, and you can see how it hangs together, where all the traffic's going and where there are problems. You'll be using distributed tracing, which will enable you to track exactly what happened to a single request as it made its way through your system.

You'll also find out that you can alter traffic flows on your cluster without changing any of your application code. Istio makes this easy, and you'll do it on this practice.
